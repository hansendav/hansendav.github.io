I arrived at the end of september with all my personal stuff in the car. My first place to stay in Salzburg - the camping site. 
Finding a room or flat is not easy. Well but this is true for every major city in Germany too. So I should have known what I will be facing. 

The EMJM Copernicus Master in Digital Earth started at the end of the week with introductions to the University of Salzburg and Z_GIS the Department of Geoinformatics.
