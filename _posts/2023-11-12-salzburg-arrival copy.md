Arriving in Salzburg was a bit of a challenge. The housing market is just as competitive as in all other big cities and the prices are unfortunately comparable. So without a room, I ended up at a campsite in the north of Salzburg at the end of September with my belongings in the car to look for a room and start my studies. Luckily, summer still felt very much at home in September and stayed a little longer. So the nights in the tent were quite pleasant. It was only the stress of finding a room in October that was a little more difficult. However, I should be lucky and get a place in a student residence right by the Salzach and the old town during the introductory events.

The introductory events of the EMJM Copernicus Master in Digital Earth took place on Thursday and Friday. Our very small group of students got an insight into the program and the Department of Geoinformatics. We were able to introduce ourselves and got to know the universities in France and Tcheschia.
