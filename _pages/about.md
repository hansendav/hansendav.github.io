Hey you, 
welcome to my personal website :wave: I am glad to introduce myself to you.

My name is David, I am a graduate student in the european study program [EMJM Copernicus Master of Digital Earth](https://master-cde.eu/). I have a strong background in forest science and LiDAR remote sensing for surveying forest stands and individual trees through my bachelor studies in forestry and environment at the University of Freiburg. To enhance my skills in handling remote sensing data, I am studying at the University of Salzburg and the University of Southern Brittany for the next two years. Presenting this journey will be content of this website.

In the navigation bar you have access to my shared projects and more personal stories in my blog. If you are interested in my work or in what I am doing during my journey, feel free to contact me :blush:
